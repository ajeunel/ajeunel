- 👀 I’m interested in data science, bias in AI and housing policy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applied data science and analytics at Howard University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that explore bias against POC in AI, enviromental factors that affect unhoused neighbors and anything that Beyonce' says is cool.
